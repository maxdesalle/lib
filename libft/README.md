# Libft
Libft is a library containing nearly all the essential functions used in C. It's the first project at 42.

Every student starts the 42 cursus by creating his own library, which will be the only one he can use in the projects which will follow, unless specifically mentioned otherwise.

The project allows you to get familiar with the some of the most foundational functions in C.

## Warning
The structure of this repository does **not** follow the guidelines. The reason for this is to add some clarity in how the files are structured. Because of that, the ```Makefile``` also differs from the one which should be used in order to follow the guidelines.

Aside from that, I have added some additional functions to the library which you don't need to submit if you are a student at 42.

## Compile
In order to use the library, simply execute:
```
make
```

To remove the ```.o``` files, execute:
```
make clean
``` 

To remove the ```.o``` files, as well as the library itself, execute:
```
make fclean
```

To recompile the whole library after making a change, simply execute:
```
make re
```
